Codes and data for the paper entitled "Learning representations of molecules to predict intermolecular interactions by constructing a large-scale heterogeneous molecular association network"
### Molecular Association Networkï¼š
contains 8 kinds of molecules, 18 types of associations, 14,315 nodes, 114,150 molecular associations.  
![Molecular Association Network](MAN.png)  
The associations among miRNA, mRNA, circRNA, lncRNA, protein, drug, disease, and microbe, including miRNA-disease associations, circRNA-disease associations, circRNA-miRNA associations, disease-mRNA associations, disease-microbe associations, drug-disease interactions, drug-mRNA associations, drug-microbe associations, drug-protein interactions, lncRNA-disease associations, lncRNA-mRNA associations, lncRNA-miRNA associations, lncRNA-protein interactions, miRNA-drug associations, miRNA-mRNA associations, miRNA-protein interactions, mRNA-protein associations, protein-protein interactions. 
### Usage manual
#### Performance evaluation
##### Data processing
Read the original association to construct the MAN network, and number the nodes
```
python MainFirst.py 
```
Randomly select the same number of negative samples as the positive samples from the association matrix, and and divide all samples into 5-fold for subsequent cross-validation.
```
python MainSecond.py
```
Obtain the network behavior features (network embedding) of biomolecule nodes in the MAN network
```
python SecondOpenNE-master/prepareFea.py
```
Generate attribute features, network behavior features, and attribute + network behavior features required for cross-validation
```
python MainThird.py
```
##### Cross-validation: 
(The codes are in the "Train5Fold\" directory)

The performance of attribute + behavior(manner) features 
```
python attribute+manner.py
```
The performance of attribute feature
```
python attribute.py
```
The performance of network behavior feature
```
python manner.py
```
Classifier comparison 
(The codes are in the "Train5Fold\4-ClassifierCompare" directory)
```
# Run the following command in the folder of each classifier
python attribute+manner.py 
```
##### Case study
Code and data are in the "case study\3TrainTestAttribute+Embedding" directory
```
python attribute+manner_casestudy.py
```
